## Overview

**Project Title**: Pong Table Game (DPong)

**Project Description**: This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game built using Python and Pygame. The game features two paddles and a bouncing ball, allowing two players to compete against each other by moving their paddles to keep the ball in play. The game resets when the ball goes out of bounds, and the paddles and ball return to their starting positions.

**Project Goals**: To create an interactive two-player game.To demonstrate the use of Python and the Pygame library for game development.
To practice implementing movement mechanics, collision detection, and user input handling.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. The very first steps that followed the installation of Python adn pygame was to import pygame in the project. 
2. First was to build the dimensions of tehe game window while incorpoarting the display. 
3. After 

Instructions for using the software:

1. Player one (left paddle) Will use "W" to move the paddle up and "S" to move the paddle down
2. Player two (Right Paddle) will use "Key Up" to move the right paddle up and "Key Down" to move it down.
3. The X red mard on the left to corner to close the game. 

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Download pygame 
* Import pygame to your game 
* Import random 
* Import math

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Fix plan to add a background 
* [ ] I plan on adding an option that's going to allow the players to each other score adn even determine a winner base on the game. 
* [ ] I plan on adding special move to intensify the game.
